# Codenames

Rules: 
Ok so codenames is a game with a minimum of four people. You make two teams, and choose one person from each team to be the spymaster (lol combinations). Basically there is a 5X5 grid (so 25) of common english words. 9 of those words go to team that starts first, 8 go to the second team, 7 are neutral, 1 is the death word. The spymasters can see which word is which, but the other players cannot see which word goes to what team.

Btw usually each player has their own grid on their own device that are connected by network, but we can just do hot seat so we don’t have to deal with network stuff at first.

Basically when it’s your teams turn, the spymaster of that team will give a one word hint and a number. You are trying to get the other players on your team to guess what words you are trying to communicate. You want to get your team to select words that are assigned to your team. The hint can not be a word on the board. The number is the amount of words that are associated with that hint. The other players can select the amount of words equal to the number the spymaster said + 1 (just in case the team tries to select a word from an earlier hint they didn’t get).

The turn is over when the players end their turn, or they click on a word that isn’t associated with their team (associated with the other team or neutral).

The game ends when a team has selected all their words, at that point they win. The game also ends if a player selects the death word, where the other team will win.

Ik that’s confusing. It’s kinda hard to explain over text.
